<p>The Bio-Fiber Development Laboratory exists to advance research into the uses of abundant and inexpensive lignocellulosic agricultural crop residues for textiles, composites, filters and other high-value-added products. Production of testable quantities of bio-fibers will allow the textile science team to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a multitude of high value products from renewable raw material resources generated by the state's agricultural systems.  </p>
