** Creating map tiles:
**********************************
Using maptiler.org

For Mac OS X 10.6+:
    From /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/map_source or http://code.google.com/p/maptiler/ get and run:
        1. http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/unixport/GDAL_Complete-1.7.dmg (nothing to do after installation)
        2. http://maptiler.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=1641967504875078876&name=maptiler-1.0-beta2fix3-macosx.zip&token=11bf9597dafa626a65cd4afa3ef5d736
    Steps in maptiler program:
        1. Google Maps Compatible
        2. "Add" the full map image from /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/map_source 
            Set "Georeference" to 40.8420 40.8112 -96.6443 -96.7198 for the UNL 3D map (current coords as of 8/18/10 for map_source/city_east_top_8-2010.png)
        3. WGS84 - Latitude and Longitude
        4. Min zoom: 14 max zoom: 18 and 
            - transparent png (then after creating them see Crushing pngs below)
            - JPEG (then after creating them see Editing JPGs below)
        5. Save in /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/www/images/tilesets/unl - dont need a destination url
        6. Dont need viewers
        7. Dont worry about details
        8. Press "Render"

Crushing pngs
    Each tile created by MapTiler is roughly 135kb - to minimize file size:
    1. From map_source or http://pngnq.sourceforge.net/ install pngnq (instuctions in the README)
    2. Run:
        cd /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/www/images/tilesets/unl
        find . -name *.png -type f -exec echo "Processing '{}'" \; -exec pngnq -n 256 {} \;
    3. The pngnq -f option which is supposed to overwrite the existing file doesn't work so we'll rename all the files ourself, removing the "-nq8":
        find . -name "*-nq8.png" -exec bash -c "mv \$1 \`echo \$1 | sed s/-nq8.png/.png/\`" -- {} \;

Editing JPGs
    This will remove edge tiles that have large blocks of white
    1. Run:
        cd /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/www/images/tilesets/unl
    2. Run:
        find . -name *.jpg -type f -exec php ../../../../map_source/process_jpgs.php {} \;
Compressing JPGs
    (Quality can be adjusted by opening the script file specified below and changing the number by the comment "set quality to suit")
    1. In Photoshop CS5: File->Scripts->Browse...
    2. Select /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/map_source/photoshop_jpg_compress_script.jsx
    3. Select /path/to/workspace/UNL_OpenMap/www/images/tilesets/unl


** Updating Map Features:
**********************************

Updating Lat/Long for Buildings
    1. Sourced from UNL_Geography_SpatialData_Campus project

Updating Buildings List/Codes
    1. Replace the /data/all_buildings.csv file obtained from FMP (Currently adjustments are made by UCOMM in additional_buildings.csv to compensate for things like SELQ, MEMS)
    2. Make sure all values (commas,quotes) are properly escaped in it
    3. Run /data/csv_to_array.php to replace buildings.inc.php and locations.inc.php

Updating Other Features
    1. Features such as Emergency Phones, Police Stations, etc are in /data as georss xml files
